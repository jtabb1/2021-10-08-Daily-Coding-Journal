    <p> 
      Today I worked on my coding project, ran some errands (1), and worked on my coding project (2), and listened to a Flatiron School 
      lecture.  Even though I didn't procrastinate much at all I feel 
      that I could have done more just by working faster and having faster 
      transitions between tasks. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Tonight and tomorrow I intend to work on tasks that I did not get to today.
